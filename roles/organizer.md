## Lightning Talks (7:15 PM)

Refer to signup sheet for a list of presenters.  Talks are 5 minutes a piece - no more.  [Timer](time.md) should keep them honest.




Take a flag of your choice from the table.
Introduce your topic.
Make a request if you would like.
Return to the group with your flag.

Who wants to start?

Possible Topics:

Code something!
Questions, road blocks
Code review
Best practices
Theory/Application
Form Groups (~5 min)

Topic leaders, when I say GO, hold your flags high and find a place in the room for your group.  Feel free to use the library’s computers or the whiteboard tables.

Everyone else, find a group you want to be in.  There’s plenty of interesting topics going on, so if you’re bored it’s your responsibility to move around and find a better fit.

If you have a flag but you don’t get enough people for your group, feel free to join another group.  Hang onto your flag though, it may start a conversation later in the night.

Alright, GO!
Workshop (~70 min - ends 8:40)

Organizer: visit groups, answer questions, make sure people are getting value
make sure groups have any resources they need
Recap (~10 min)

Can I get everyone’s attention?  Let’s get back together for a debriefing.

Anything you learned that you’d like to share with the group?
Please see mailing list and feedback form at http://phoenixjavascript.org/resources.html

Breakdown

Please put chairs, tables and other resources back where you found them.  The library closes in 10 minutes, so let’s be out before then.  Feel free to continue the conversation outside the library when we’re done.
