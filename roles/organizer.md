# Boring Official

The Boring Official's job is to guide the session, introduce speakers, and lead general discussions.  Following is the agenda for our meetups.

## Doors open (7:00 PM)

Let people network and grab pizza until 7:10.

## Intro (7:10 PM)

```speech
Welcome to the Javascript Workshop!  Thanks for coming.  If you haven’t already, please help yourself to some pizza.

Just to give a brief overview for those of you who haven't attended before, we'll be starting out with some lightning talks on various subjects, and after that you'll be free to hack on projects or learning exercises.  Many of the presenters will have follow up material to their talks, so you'll have a chance to dig in and try things for yourself.

Thanks to our sponsors:

We're going to get started shortly with lightning talks.  Make your way over to the projector screen and gather round.  If you're a presenter, please come to the front and have your laptop ready.
```

## Lightning Talks (7:15 PM)

Refer to signup sheet for a list of presenters.  Talks are 5 minutes a piece - no more.  The [Keeper of Time](time.md) is responsible for holding them accountable.  Only 6 slots are available, so if more people want to present, they'll have to wait for the next meetup.

```
Alright, let's get started.  Talks are 5 minutes a piece, and we have [6] talks.  Our first presenter will be ______.  When you're finished with your talk, if you have a follow up exercise please see our Keeper of Flags.
```

Take a flag of your choice from the table.
Introduce your topic.
Make a request if you would like.
Return to the group with your flag.

Who wants to start?

Possible Topics:

Code something!
Questions, road blocks
Code review
Best practices
Theory/Application
Form Groups (~5 min)

Topic leaders, when I say GO, hold your flags high and find a place in the room for your group.  Feel free to use the library’s computers or the whiteboard tables.

Everyone else, find a group you want to be in.  There’s plenty of interesting topics going on, so if you’re bored it’s your responsibility to move around and find a better fit.

If you have a flag but you don’t get enough people for your group, feel free to join another group.  Hang onto your flag though, it may start a conversation later in the night.

Alright, GO!
Workshop (~70 min - ends 8:40)

Organizer: visit groups, answer questions, make sure people are getting value
make sure groups have any resources they need
Recap (~10 min)

Can I get everyone’s attention?  Let’s get back together for a debriefing.

Anything you learned that you’d like to share with the group?

## Breakdown

Please put chairs, tables and other resources back where you found them.  The library closes in 10 minutes, so let’s be out before then.  Feel free to continue the conversation outside the library when we’re done.
