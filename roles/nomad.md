# Nomadic Wizard

As a nomadic wizard, you will wander from group to group looking for hobbits in need.

Whilst wandering, you may hear something that causes your eyebrows to furrow, and you may find yourself starting to open your mouth and tell a person that they are wrong.  Before you do, please ask yourself these questions:

  1. Is it important that I tell them they are wrong?
  2. Will they find out very soon anyway?
  3. Is there any immediate danger in the course of action they intend to take?
  4. Are they having fun?
  5. How can I enhance their fun and learning?
