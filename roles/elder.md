As a member of the esteemed...  No wait, that's not [how we do things around here](../docs/code.md).

If you're in this group you have commit access within the JSVillage organization on github.  Your job is to triage pull requests, give the authors feedback on any changes they should make, and ultimately to accept new ideas into our playbook.  We want the process of submitting changes to be friendly, non-judgemental, and quick, and we need your help to make it happen!

Pull requests must meet these requirements:

  1. Principle: Does not violate any of the [founding principles](../docs/code.md).
  2. Style: If the pull request contains code, then it should comply with our style guide.  If it contains prose, then it should comply with the grammatical constraints of the English language.  If it contains poetry, then all bets are off.

Additionally, you may make requests, ask questions, and offer feedback on any aspect of the submission.  Use your best judgement on what's important, and remember that your goal is to serve them in helping their submission be accepted.

# When conflict arises

Notably, you are not allowed to simply turn the author away.  If a conflict arises where you and the author disagree about what changes should be made, you can first ask for mediation from another member of the council.  If that fails, please refer to the full mediation process.

## Involving other group members

As long as you feel that the request will not be disruptive to the group you are free to approve the change yourself and do not need to involve any others.

If you wish though, feel free to consult any other members of the council.

If the change will have an impact others in the group, then we should consult those who will be impacted.  Ask for their feedback before coming to a decision.

## Submitting your own changes

Notably, your commit access does not entitle you to circumvent the process for submitting changes.  You still must fork the repository and submit a pull request.  Your request must be approved by another member of the Elder Council.
