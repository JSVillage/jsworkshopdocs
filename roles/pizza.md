# Bringer of Pizza

Our magic formula is 1 pizza per 10 RSVPs, and also a 2 litre bottle of soda per 20 RSVPs.  We have paper plates, napkins, and cups stored at the library.

Please check the RSVPs on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-JavaScript/events/) the day of the event, and order the pizza for delivery at the library at 6:45 PM.  Let the event coordinator know when you have placed the order.

You have our eternal gratitude, Bringer of Pizza!
