# Subject Matter Expert

You're an expert at something.  Yay!  And you're here to share some of what you know!  Even better!  We welcome you to our group, and we hope you find the experience rewarding.  This is a guide that outlines our expectations of presenters.

# Values

We value:

 * Participation - Find ways to involve us in the material!  We learn best when we DO.
 * Ego-less Leadership - Help us to explore the space you're interested in.  Help us understand WHY you've settled on your particular way of doing things.
 * Open Mind - You never know who might be in the audience.  You might learn something too!

# Format

There are two formats that you can prepare materials for: Lightning Talk and Workshop.

## Lightning Talk

This is a five minute talk.  The goal is to get people excited about your topic!  You might consider some variation on the "start with the why" format:

  1. Why is this topic important?
  2. How are you going to go about educating us?
  3. What are the specific areas you will cover?

## Workshop

Over an hour of the meetup is dedicated to "workshop" time, where members are free to form groups and work on topics that interest them.  As a subject matter expert, you are encouraged to lead a group!

There are a couple of formats you could choose for this:

  * Discussion Group
  * Pen/Paper Exercise
  * Coding/Digital Creation Exercise

Think about what takeaways you would like the people in your group to have.  How can you impart some skill or insight that they might not have had before?  Is there some accomplishment that they can attain within an hour's time?  How can you involve them in creative problem solving?

An hour might sound like a long time, but it's really not.  It takes focus in order to keep things moving and make sure you reach your target.

It's helpful to print out instructions for the group.  Groups are normally 5-10 people, so print out at least 10 copies.

## Conclusions

We'd love to have you do both a talk and a workshop, but it's up to you!  Good luck, and feel free to contact us, or reach out on the mailing list if you have questions!
