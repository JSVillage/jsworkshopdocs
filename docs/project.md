# Project Instructions

So you've decided to start a project!  Fantastic!

This guide is here to help walk you through the process of determining WHY you want to do a project, HOW you'd like to go about it, and WHAT the design should be.

## Elect a Timer

First off, go ahead and elect someone in your group to keep track of time and write down the ideas you come up with.  Feel free to start a thread on the mailing list for your group:

## Meet Your Team (~10 min)

Let's meet each other!  Go around the circle and introduce yourselves.  Here are some questions that might help.

  * What inspires you about programming?
  * What special talents or background do you bring to your team?
  * In what ways would you like to contribute?

## Project Ideas (~30 min)

Here are some ideas to help you get started.  If you have other ideas, bring them up with your team!

  * Perform some useful function (calculator, clock, information dashboard)
  * Tell a story (switching out an image is a simple way, game or drawing libraries might help you do something more advanced)

## Set Up Tools (~15 min)

  * Github:  https://github.com - Find other projects that you can build on.  Publish your own work.
  * Cloud9:  https://c9.io - Browser/cloud based development environment.  You can use this on the library computers and your workspace will still be there next time, even if you use a different computer.

These are just suggestions.  If your team has a better way of doing things, don’t let us stop you.  In fact, we’d love to hear what you’re doing, so please mention your approach on the mailing list, or submit a pull request to these docs!

## Environment Setup / Tutorial (remaining time)

Unfortunately we don’t have great curated environments yet to get you started quickly.  Over time, as we do more of this we can pave a path so that it becomes easier.

If you don’t know where to start, try Meteor.  Here are some links to help you get started:

Setting Up Meteor on Cloud9: https://docs.c9.io/v1.0/docs/meteor
Meteor Tutorial:  https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/getting-started-with-meteor/
Meteor Docs: http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/

Experienced team members:  If you have a favorite way to start new projects, let’s try it!  Please be sensitive to the backgrounds of your team and try to select something that everyone will feel comfortable contributing to, and is excited to learn about.

## Before You Leave

Please get contact info from your team mates, and find out how much time you all wish to dedicate to this.  You can stay in touch on the mailing list, or in group emails, or any other means you wish.

## Next Month

If you'd like to present your work, [sign up for a lightning talk](../role/expert.md)!  This might help you recruit new members, or just get recognition.

Long Term Vision

These projects are an excellent way to hone your skills and learn from other people in the community.

But beyond that, we would like to give you the opportunity to get feedback on your work from your fellow community members, and also to make your portfolio visible to recruiters and potential employers.  We will do this by building a gallery website that showcases your work, and by giving you the opportunity to present in person at the Javascript Workshops.

Looking forward to seeing the fun projects that people will create, and the relationships that are forged!  Please let us know if you have any questions or feedback.
