Every one of us chooses to be here, for one reason or another.  Recognize your own choice, and open your mind to what others are bringing.  You may find answers to questions you didn't know you had.

These are our principles:

  1. We are here to learn.  We ask questions of the world around us.
  2. We look for the good in others.  We do not discriminate based on race, gender, age, experience level, or anything else.
  3. We help each other grow and explore.
  4. We do not seek authority or power over each other.

We collaborate through an open governence model.  We can all submit changes to the process and roles, and over time we will get better at working together.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, then come join us!
