Join us at the library for mentorship, code reviews, discussion of best practice, and whatever coding or software questions are on your mind.

If you're a beginner, this is a great opportunity to get feedback from experienced programmers. If you're intermediate or advanced, it's a great place to get feedback on your ideas and help your fellow coders out with some mentorship.
