We hold the following assumptions about our volunteers:

  1. We are creative, thoughtful, trustworthy people, capable of making important decisions.
  2. We are accountable and responsible for our decisions and actions.
  3. We are fallible.  Sometimes we make mistakes.
  4. Each one of us has unique capabilities and experience.
  5. We want to use our talents and skills to make a positive contribution to the world.

In contrast to what you may have experienced at work or in other organizations, we really do trust you to do what is right.  The roles are here to guide us, but if they're wrong or need to be modified, we have a [process](#elder) for changing them.

So, be the change you wish to see in the world.  Come help us out, and we'll figure out how to build a vibrant community together.
